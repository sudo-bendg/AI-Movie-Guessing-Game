# AI Movie Guessing Game

A command-line game where an AI generates a redacted description of a random movie, and the player must guess which movie it is. As the player guesses, the description becomes progressively less redacted. Incorrect guesses may result in the AI providing a hint or simply displaying a message indicating that the guess was incorrect.

## ✨ Features
- 🤖 AI-generated movie descriptions
- 🔍 Progressive unveiling of the movie description
- 💡 Dynamic hints on incorrect guesses
- 🎲 Unlimited attempts (turn limit may be added in future updates)

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Run the script in the command line.
2. The game will display a redacted description of a movie.
3. Enter your guess.
4. If incorrect, the game will either provide a hint or simply indicate the guess was wrong.
5. Keep guessing until you identify the correct movie.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- ⏳ Implement a turn limit to prevent infinite guessing.
- 🧠 Improve AI hint generation for incorrect guesses.
- 📝 Enhance redaction techniques for better difficulty scaling.
